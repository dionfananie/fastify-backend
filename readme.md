set httponly for avoiding XSS cyber attack.

A cookie with the HttpOnly attribute can't be modified by JavaScript, for example using Document.cookie; it can only be modified when it reaches the server. Cookies that persist user sessions for example should have the HttpOnly attribute set â€” it would be really insecure to make them available to JavaScript. This precaution helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
